# Controls:
- Player 1 controls: 'w' for up, 's' for down 
- Player 2 controls: Up and Down arrows 

- the ball speeds up on each bounce off a paddle 
- speed resets after one of the players missing the ball which gets the other +1 point


KNOWN BUGS (to be fixed):
-when ball hits the edge of a paddle it zigzags which adds +1 to score a multiple times, then bounces like it would normally
-if the scoreboard is shown from the start as 0:0, the updated score doesnt overwrite it but writes on top of the previous one
-replit lags on key controls of the paddles
